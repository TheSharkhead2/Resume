\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth} % 40% of the page width for the introduction text
	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
	
	I am a student enthusiastic about mathematics, computer science, and physics. I aim to understand computer programs at 
	all levels and enjoy implementing features from scratch. I love exploring math education and enjoy teaching
	concepts in any capacity. In everything I do, I aim to understand the world around me better: building
	simulations of our world, finding intuitive ways to understand how our physical world works, and learning mathematical abstractions
	to model anything I can.
